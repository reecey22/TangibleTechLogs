Design 1:  In my initial design, I was leaning toward creating a pop-up business card that reflected my love for computing. While doing this, I realized the complexity of my design and decided to consider some simpler options as I iterated. For example, in designs five(5) and six(6), I considered a design that included a glued-in, rather than pop-up butterfly. In my final design, given time constraints, I reasoned it would be more fruitful if I stuck with cutting out the designs instead and reserving pop-up graphics for later. 

This change (the leap in this approach) occured around design six, when I choose chic simplicity over something extravagant and complex. I do believe in some ways my design followed the design funnel approach since, I started out with a broad idea of what I wanted my graphic to look like (a pop-up matching my personality). As I iterated through different pop-up designs and realized its complexity (i.e. gathered information), I considered a more practical alternative (i.e. laser cutting), and moved forward to Implementation and Integration into my design.
