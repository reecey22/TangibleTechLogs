Pitch 1

Hi! I’m Shaniah Reece, a 2nd-year PhD student passionate about finding technical solutions to everyday problems. For my project, I’m harnessing the power of paper-based technology to create a smart checklist that syncs seamlessly with your mobile phone or any platform you choose. With just a quick swipe, this checklist transforms your paper-based data into digital, bridging the gap between paper simplicity and digital efficiency. It’s fast, intuitive, and designed to fit right into your workflow.

Do you love the efficiency of digital tools but find that old-fashioned paper helps you focus and stay on task? Why settle for one or the other? My project brings the best of both worlds by offering a paper-based design that instantly translates your notes and checklists to digital with just a tap. Yup, you heard that right—paper. This project is simple, seamless, and perfect for anyone who loves working with paper but wants the convenience of digital tracking. Give it a try and see how it transforms your workflow!

Pitch 3

Large classrooms can make it hard for professors to connect with students, especially when it comes to recognizing when they need help or gauging engagement. That’s where EduCube comes in! EduCube is a simple, interactive tool designed to improve communication in classrooms by allowing students to send real-time feedback to their professors. With a tap or a light, students can signal their needs discretel, and professors can see and respond to these cues. Whether it’s a question, a need for clarification, or just checking in, EduCube makes participation easy and accessible. It’s straightforward, intuitive, and built to bring professors closer to their students, even in large lecture halls. Would you like to learn more?
