Pitch 1: Hello! My name is Shaniah Reece. I am a 2nd year PhD student who loves finding technical solutions to everyday problem. For my project I will be leveraging the power of paper-based technology to create a paper-based checklist that syncs to your mobile phone or anywhere you want it to go. With a quick swipe on this checklist, you will quickly convert your data from paper based to digital. 

Pitch 2: Do you enjoy the efficiency of digital technologies but prefer old-fashioned paper to stay focused and get the job done? Why choose? My project offers a design that allows you to easily translate paper-based data to digital at the tap of your paper. Yup! You heard me right, paper. Give it a go and tell me what you think!
