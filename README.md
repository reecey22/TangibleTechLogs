## Overview 📄

Welcome to my Physical Computing Journal! This repository tracks my progress in learning about the physical computing field and building interactive projects: from brainstorming ideas, to logging cool technologies I see, to implementing hardware and software solutions in a 'final project'. Explore my sketches, coding samples, and reflections at each phase of my journey.

## About this Journal
This journal was initiated as a requirement for my physical computing class, and was designed to be malleable. As I gain competence in the field, I use this journal to:
* brainstorm
* sketch and design new ideas
* document my thoughts/reflections
* keep track of code I used
* build a portfolio
